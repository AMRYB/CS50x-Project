### Project Title: Login System with JavaScript, Python, and MySQL

#### Video Demo: [Video URL Here]

#### Description:
The **Login System with JavaScript, Python, and MySQL** is a full-stack web application that allows users to sign up, log in, and access a secure area of the application. This project is built using Python with the Flask web framework and MySQL for database management. 

### Features:
1. **User Registration**: Users can register by providing their username, email, and password. The password is securely hashed and stored in the database using a hashing algorithm to ensure security.
2. **Login**: Registered users can log in using their username and password. If the credentials are valid, they are redirected to a secure page; otherwise, an error message is displayed.
3. **Database**: A MySQL database is used to store user data. The project includes a simple SQL schema file (`CDatabase.sql`) that sets up the required tables and fields.
4. **Session Management**: Flask sessions are used to manage the logged-in state of users. Once logged in, the user's session remains active until they log out or the session expires.
5. **Front-End**: The application uses basic HTML and CSS to render the user interface, with form validation using JavaScript to ensure that the user fills out the required fields and enters a valid password.

### Files Overview:
- **main.py**: The core backend file, where the Flask application is initialized. It handles the routing, user registration, and login functionalities.
- **app_test.py**: Contains test cases to verify the functionality of the application, ensuring everything works as expected.
- **unit_test.py**: Additional test cases for specific features or functions.
- **CDatabase.sql**: SQL script to create the necessary database and tables for storing user information.
- **requirements.txt**: Lists the necessary dependencies for the project, such as Flask and MySQL connector.
- **run**: A shell script to run the application easily.
- **static/validate.js**: JavaScript file for form validation. It ensures the user inputs the correct data before submitting the login form.
- **templates/**: Contains HTML files, including the login page where users can log in and sign up.

### Design Decisions:
- **Flask**: Flask was chosen as the web framework for its simplicity and flexibility in building web applications. It allows for easy routing and integration with a MySQL database.
- **MySQL**: MySQL was selected as the database due to its reliability and performance in handling relational data. It also integrates seamlessly with Flask.
- **Security**: Passwords are hashed using a secure hashing algorithm (e.g., bcrypt or SHA256) before being stored in the database to prevent unauthorized access in case of a data breach.
- **Sessions**: Flask sessions are used to manage user login status, ensuring users can stay logged in while navigating the app.

### Setup Instructions:
1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Install the necessary dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Set up the MySQL database:
   - Run the `CDatabase.sql` script in your MySQL environment to create the necessary tables.
4. Run the Flask application:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```
   The app will be available at `http://localhost:5000`.
5. Open the browser and navigate to the login page to test the registration and login functionalities.

### Future Improvements:
- **Email Verification**: Implement email verification to ensure users provide valid email addresses during registration.
- **Password Reset**: Allow users to reset their passwords if they forget them by sending a password reset link to their email.
- **User Roles**: Add different user roles (e.g., admin, user) to give admins access to the user management area.
- **Two-Factor Authentication**: Integrate two-factor authentication for enhanced security.

This project serves as a foundational login system that can be expanded with additional features to suit specific use cases.
